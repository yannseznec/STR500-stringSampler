### STR500 Build notes (v1.0 and 1.1)

## Important note for v1.0
The PCB for v1.0 has a mistake on the silkscreen, which implies that the diode should be mounted backwards. Make sure to flip the diode around to that the flow of electricty goes from the edge of the board towards the Daisy. Check the picture for clarity.

## Wiring the Molex connectors
For ease of build I used pre-wired 6-way Molex connectors for the audio inputs, outputs, and footswitch controls. I also used a pre-wired 2-way connector for Power.

Check the pictures for information on how to wire these. Note that one wire on each input and output connector is unused. Be sure to mount the sockets in the correct orientation to ensure that the color coding makes sense.

For extra clarity, here is the order of connections written out:

# Gametrak
I generally use a second generation Gametrak, which is easiest to disassemble and reassemble into a new container. When you disassemble a second generation Gametrak you will get two string cartridges. On the potentiometer the wires are connected using a JST connector. On the PCB you have two choices:
1. use an identical JST connector to the one on the Gametrak, and connect the gametrak to the PCB using a socket-to-socket five pin JST cable (you can buy these premade or crimp them yourself), or solder some 2.54" pins to the PCB and connect the gametrak to those somehow. The Gametrak wires are color-coded, and the order needs to be preserved to work on the PCB. These are:
- Green: Power
- Yellow: Joystick X (or Y? it's sometimes difficult to guess)
- Orange: string pull distance
- Red: Joystick Y (or X...)
- Brown: Ground

See the pictures to make sure. 

# Capacitors
These are kind of optional, they should theoretically lessen the noise on the audio output. Different values may give you different results, and the audio will work perfectly fine without them (albeit with some noise). I'm still undecided on the best approach to these.

# Buttons
These boards use pretty standard "tactile" buttons. The bigger buttons are the "12x12" footprint and the small ones are "6x6". I don't think it's necessary for you to get the same exact ones I've been using, especially if you are making your own enclosure. 

# Daisy Seed & Pure Data
The software is made in Pure Data. I would recommend using Plug Data for flashing the code. To load the code onto the Daisy, open the "_mainPatch.pd" file and go to the "compile" window from the menu in Plug Data. Choose "Electro-Smith Daisy". Set the Target Board to "Custom JSON" and select the "granularDaisy.json" file. Set Blocksize to 10, samplerate to 48000, and Patch size to "Big + SDRAM". On the Seed, press and hold "Boot" and then press "reset". Then click "Flash" in the compiler. This should load the code onto the Daisy. If you need help with any of that I suggest first checking the Daisy getting started pages!
